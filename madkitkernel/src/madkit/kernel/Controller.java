/**
 * A controller, as it name implies, controls the behavior of an agent.
 * A controller is an abstraction of the internal architecture of an agent.
 * It is possible to describe the general capabilities (skills of an agent)
 * and try different controllers for this agent.
 * <p> It is also handy for integrating new scripting languages into madkit and
 * makes those scripting language work for "synchronous" as well as "asynchronous" agents.
 * See the integration of the Jess (rule based system) and kawa (scheme) agents.</p>
 * <p> Warning: you may "plug" a behavior into an agent at creation time as follows:</p>
 * <pre>
 * class myAgent extends .... {
 *      myAgent(){
 *          setController(new MyController());
 *      }
 * }
 * </pre>
