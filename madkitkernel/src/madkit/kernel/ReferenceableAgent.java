/**The ability for a MadKit agent to be spied or scheduled in
   synchronous mode is enabled by implementing the AccessibleAgent
   interface. Class that do not implement this interface will not be
   returned by the kernel to Watchers or Schedulers, and thus will
   not be able to play in reactive/synchronous systems.

   Note that this interface is empty. It is the responsability of the
   developer to decide if a MadKit agent can appear in reactive
   systems. As reactive system MadKit implementation envolves direct
   references manipulation, that could be a potential security hole
   for "classical" agents. 

   Developers of reactive systems should not inherit from Agent or a
   subclass but from AbstractAgent. The Agent class defines a threaded
   implementation for agents, which is a definitive overkill for
   reactive systems in most cases. Just use a AbstractAgent subclass
   and appropriate Schedulers.
