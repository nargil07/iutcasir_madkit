/** The main MadKit AbstractAgent class. Provides support for non threaded agent
 * lifecycle, messaging, graphical interface, group and roles
 * management, agent information, ...
 *
 * The agent behavior intentionnaly is *not* defined. It is up to the
 * agent developer to choose an agent model or to develop his specific
 * agent library on top of the facilities provided by MadKit. However,
 * all agent share the same organizational view, and the basic
 * messaging code, so integration of agent coming from different
 * developer and having heterogeneous models is quite easy.
 *
 * Agent-related methods (almost everything here) can invoked only
 * after registration in the kernel (i.e. after the activate() method has been called
 * on this agent). That means that you should not use any of the agent methods in
 * constructor

/**Due to the "Thread problem" (see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/index.html for more details)
when an agent is killed, by another agent or interface (unvolontary end: whithout exiting of the <code>live</code> method)
the Kernel will try a Thread.stop on it. And the Thread problem is that this method is currently unsafe and does not work
every time. The result is that the agent has been killed, that is to say removed from organizations and invisible by others (no more messages),
but its thread is still alive with unpredictable behaviors, wasting cpu time.
The sun API says :
"Most uses of stop should be replaced by code that simply modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should stop running. The target thread
should check this variable regularly, and return from its run method in an orderly fashion if the variable indicates that it is to stop running. (This is the approach
that JavaSoft's Tutorial has always recommended.)  "

In MadKit, agents are autonomous :)

So it is the developper responsability to be sure that an agent cleanly exit its thread when dying.
The <code>exitImmediatlyOnKill</code> method is made to easy this procedure.
When a dead agent, that has been killed, calls this method, its thread immediatly exits if it is still running, avoiding to become a "zombie agent"
For example this kind of agent may not be able to be cleanly killed by another due to its simplicity (no wait, no pause).
