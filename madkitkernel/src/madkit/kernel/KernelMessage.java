/** This message class is used for communication between the
    KernelAgent and system agents to get information about the current
    state of the platform, subscribe to common hooks, ...

    Any platform service beside group/role management and local
    messaging and lifecycle is handled by agents, thus an extension
    mechanism is needed. That is what the KernelAgent (role "kernel"
    in group "system") and the hooks mechanism is for.
