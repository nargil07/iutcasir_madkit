    <h2 class="title" style="clear: both">The communicator agent</h2>
    <p>The communicator agent is used to give MadKit its distributed capabilities 
      and allows MadKit platforms to form a network of kernels from which agents 
      may communicate transparently.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>MadKit in distributed mode use an important agent called the <tt>Communicator</tt>. 
    This agent provides distributed message passing through socket connections. 
    It runs a small socket server (on the port 4444 by default). To link with 
    another platform, you have to give the host name and optionnally the port 
    on which the distant <tt>Communicator</tt> is listening. For instance: <tt>khazar.lirmm.fr</tt> 
    and <tt>4444</tt></p>
  <p>It also handles organizational information synchronization on multiple distant 
    agent kernel. Communities, groups and roles created on a platform in distributed 
    mode are seen from the other connected platforms. </p>
  <p> Once the connection is made between two kernels, all organization tables 
    are synchronized. Thus groups (and their respective roles and agents) which 
    have been created in distributed mode are automatically seen by both kernels, 
    assuming that the two kernels are connected to the communities where these 
    groups belongs. </p>
  <p><span class="bold"><b>Note: </b></span>When you want to connect to an already 
    formed network, i.e. several kernels connected together, just connect to one 
    of them. All subsequent connections between your kernel and the other ones 
    will be done automatically. The following figure shows such a connection. 
    When a kernel, called <tt>yourKernel</tt> wants to connect to an already formed 
    network (a), it just has to connect to one of them, for instance the kernel 
    located on the <tt>toto</tt> host (b). Then this kernel is connected to all 
    the other kernel (c).

  <div class="procedure">
    <p><b>Procedure 1. </b></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p> From the MadKit Desktop, you may Launch the "Communicator" either 
          by selecting the <b>Agents</b><b>&gt;Communicator</b> menuitem, or, 
          from the directory explorer, by double clicking on the <tt>DynamicTwoChannelsCommunicator</tt> 
          agent situated in the <tt>Communicator.jar</tt> Jar. </p>
        <p><img src="images/communicator1.gif" width="404" height="412"></p>
        <p> Its property box lists the current communication port (4444 by default). 
          If the server starts up correctly, the small LED on the agent turns 
          green. You may notice the <tt>SiteAgent</tt> window which displays the 
          set of available communities. Here, the local kernel is connected to 
          two communities: the <tt>public</tt> community which is the general 
          community to which all kernels are automatically connected (you cannot 
          disconnect your kernel from the <tt>public</tt> community), and the 
          <tt>travel</tt> community which is created by the <tt>travelagents</tt> 
          demo application. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> To connect with a remote kernel, just type its hostname (and port 
          if necessary). Let us suppose that we want to connect with a host called 
          <tt>lucrece</tt> (type your desired host name, lucrece is a fake name). 
          The host name maybe any correct Internet name, such as <tt>kant.lirmm.fr</tt> 
          for instance). 
        <p><img src="images/communicator2.gif" width="391" height="424"></p>
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  <p>Once the "Add" button clicked, if the distributed mode bootstrap succeeded, 
    a MadKit kernel name (actually a host name) appears in the Communicator. 
  <p><img src="images/communicator3_bis.gif" width="692" height="422"></p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Communities appear in the <tt>SiteAgent</tt> window. If you want to use 
    the applications associated to specific communities, check the related items 
    in this window. This will &#8220;connect&#8221; the kernel to those communities, 
    making the groups, roles and agents of this communities accessible from it. 
    (<span class="bold"><b>Note: </b></span> you may have to click the <tt>refresh</tt> 
    button of the browser, to see the new communities in the browser). 
  <p><img src="images/communicator4.gif" width="713" height="519"></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To test the distributed mode, you can use any classic demo, see for instance 
    the {{link }}travel demo or the {{link}} Chat application. </p>
  <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
    <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
    <p>For strange reasons, it is not possible to disconnect a kernel from a network 
      of kernels. For the moment, the best thing to do is to simply quit MadKit. 
      This will be solved in the future. </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Programming the communicator</h3>
  <p>The communicator is an agent and, as such, it may interact with other agents. 
    Its communications are very simple. The communicator may be asked to attempt 
    connexion to another kernel and get the port on which the communicator is 
    listening. All messages are messages of the class <code>StringMessage</code>.</p>
  <p>You can pilot the <tt>Communicator</tt> from another agent by sending it 
    a simple <tt>StringMessage</tt> with "<b><tt>add-host <i><tt>machine</tt></i><i><tt>port</tt></i></tt></b>" 
    as the content. It will attempt connexion upon message reception. </p>
  <p>It is also possible to know the port on which the <tt>Communicator</tt> is 
    runing by sending a <tt>StringMessage</tt> with <b><tt>get-port</tt></b> in 
    content string.</p>
</div>
      <h3 class="title"><a name="communicator_options"></a>Options</h3>
  <p>It is possible to automatically run a communicator at launch time, using 
    among the two following possibilities: 
  <div class="orderedlist">
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Start a MadKit kernel with <tt>--communicator-on</tt>. For instance, 
          type the following command: 
        <table border="1" bgcolor="#E0E0E0">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <pre class="screen"><b><tt><tt>$</tt>java madkit.platform.console.Booter --communicator-on</tt></b></pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        to start a MadKit kernel in console mode, with an active communicator. 
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You may also use a <a href="../../userguide/userguide.html#configfile" target="_top">configuration 
          file</a> which contains a Communicator agent. Insert the following line 
          into a configuration file: 
        <table border="1" bgcolor="#E0E0E0">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;launch-agent name="communicator" type="Java"	code="agents.network.communicator.DynamicTwoChannelsCommunicator"/&gt;</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
