<p><a href="http://www.warbot.org"><img src="images/warbot2.jpg" width="229" height="117" border="0"></a><a href="warbot2.html"><img src="images/bfrancais_01.gif" border="0" height="18" width="18"></a>Congratulations! You
have succeeded in running the Warbot simulation. </p>
<p>You have certainly noticed that, after a finite  (maybe long ;-) time, the
two home bases are destroyed.</p>
<p>In order to understand what has happened, let us focus on the behaviours of
  our agents. To do that, let us stop the simulation with the <img src="images/stop.jpg" height="24" width="37"> button.
  Let us select an agent on the Warbot window, for instance a green launcher,
  and select,
  on top of the Warbot window, the lens icon <img src="images/loupe.jpg" height="24" width="25">.
  This makes a window to appear, showing us the properties of our agent, including
  its class:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/propedit0.jpg" alt="" height="239" width="445"> </p>
<p>The <tt>RastaRocket</tt> launchers fire against any perceived ennemy,
  and eat any perceived hamburger. Their behavior is defined <a href="../samples/RastaRocket.java" target="_blank">in
  a Java file </a>. Let us have a glance at the source files of this behavior. We first
  see that it is a subclass of <tt>Brain</tt>, and that two methods are redefined
  in the class:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <tt>activate()</tt> method, in which the agent announce itself to the
    other agents and the MadKit console.</li>
  <li>the <tt>doIt()</tt>  method, which is the actual behavior of our agent.
    This behavior is based on calls to the predefined method <tt>getPercepts()</tt> which
    returns the array of all the objects and agents which are in the perception
    area, of our agent. </li>
</ul>
<p>The behavior of our launcher is then to review all the perceived entities.
  For each of them, he will test its type, using the predefined method <tt>getPerceptType()</tt> which
  returns a <tt>String</tt> giving the kind of the percept ("Home, "Food", "RocketLauncher",
  "Explorer",...), test its team, using the predefined method <tt>getTeam()</tt> which
  returns a <tt>String</tt> that the agent can compare to its own team,
  in order to decide whether he fires against, using the predefined method <tt>launchRocket(...)</tt>  or
  if he eats it, using the predefined method <tt>eat()</tt>. </p>
<p>This behavior is not really cooperative, but we can notice that our agent
  does nothing when he perceives agents from his own team, and that he does neither
  send nor receive any message. Then, it would be easy to add a few things to
  this behavior to make it  more cooperative.</p>
<p>Let us now focus on the red explorer. Its property window shows an additional
  property:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.warbot.org"><img src="images/propedit1.jpg" width="445" height="186" border="0"></a></p>
<p>This agent  is defined in
Python. As this language is an interpreted one, a <a href="../samples/simpleexplore.py">script
file</a> is
part of the agent, whose <tt>brainclass</tt> is <tt>PythonBrain</tt>. Let us
edit this file.</p>
<p>We can notice that, once again, two methods are defined:
  <tt>activate()</tt> and <tt>doIt()</tt>. We alsio ee a <tt>end()</tt> method
  whose action is to print <tt>bye
  bye</tt>.
  The <tt>activate()</tt> allows, as usually in MadKit, the agent to announce
  his venue. The <tt>doIt()</tt> method defines what is the actual behavior of
  the agent.</p>
<p>The behavior of opur explorer is, like for the previous kind of agent, to
  review all the  percepts. For each of them, it tests
  its kind by calling the <tt>getPerceptType()</tt> method,
  which is called both in Python and in Java, and its team, by the <tt>getTeam()</tt> method.
  This agent is interested by homes: when it perceives one, and after checking
  its team, then il informs all the launchers which belong to its team of the
  position of the enemy home, through a call to <span class="Style1"><tt>self.broadcast(groupName,"launcher","homeposition",str(self.getX()),str(self.getY()))</tt></span>.
  If it sees food, it eats it, by calling the <tt>eat()</tt> method. When there
  is nothing to eat, it moves in the window, by calling the <tt>move()</tt> method.</p>
<p>This agent is a little bit more cooperative than the previous one,
  as it sends messages. The agents which receive these messages are the red launchers.
  Their <tt>brainclass</tt> is <tt>HomeKiller</tt> and their behavior is defined <a href="../samples/HomeKiller.java" target="_blank">in
  a Java class </a>.</p>
<p>The <tt>doIt()</tt> method is similar to the <tt>RastaRocket</tt> method
  (fire any entity which is not from its team), with only an additional action
  when it receives a message from the explorer, which says to go near the enemy
  home and fire against it. This behavior is not a sophistiated one, but is complementary
  of the previous one, then they fit each other inside the same team.</p>
<p>The remaining kind of agent , defined <a href="../samples/Ant.java">in
    a Java class </a>, is the green explorer, which is in the same team as the <tt>RastaRocket</tt>
  launcher: its behavior is "ant-like":
  it looks for food, it bounces against obstacles, and bring back  home the food
  it found
  (eating only 10% of it). It is not more a cooperative behavior than its launcher
  's one: so they fit each other inside the team ;-). </p>
