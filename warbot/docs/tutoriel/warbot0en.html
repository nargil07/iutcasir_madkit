  launched  Warbot:
  congratulations.
</p>
<p>You are now in front of a display which should look like this :</p>
<p><img src="images/warbot1.jpg" height="438" width="532"> Click to enlarge </p>
<p>This display is made of two elements: The Warbot environment, bounded by walls,
  and a window containing tabs.</p>
<p>Each tab in the bottom of the screen represents
  a team, except: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the <tt>dumb</tt> tab which represents the two demo teams <img src="images/dumb.jpg" height="64" width="252">(a
    red one and a green one),</li>
  <li>the <tt>objects</tt> tab which represents objects that can be put in
    the environment <img src="images/objects.jpg" height="46" width="120">(a
    hamburger, a wall and a weapon). </li>
</ul>
<p>Each team is made of a home and two kinds of agents:
   explorers and launchers. Home itself is also s special kind of agent.
  The three icons under the tabs enable the uset to select what kind of agent
  is to be created. Once this selection is done, a clic in the empty area allow
  to point at its initial position in the Warbot environment.</p>
<p>We have now to populate such a desperately empty screen. To do so, let us
  select the dumb tab. Let us add to our world a home, 6 launchers and 8 explorers
  (in each team:
  a red one and a green one). Then let us add thirty hamburgers, 6 walls and
  3 weapons (which appear as small points in the environment: they are hidden
  in the soil).</p>
<p>We obtain a display which looks like  <a href="warbot1en.html">this</a>. </p>
