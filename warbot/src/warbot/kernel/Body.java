/** This interface gives all the avaible primitive possible for brains.
these methods can be directly invoked inside the <code> doIt </code> method of a <class> Brain </class>.
Some of them represent actions that cost time and energy.
As the <method> doIt </method> method represents what you want your body to do when it is time to act,
invoke the <method> move </method> method several time in the doIt is useless : your body can do this only once.
<code> move </code>, <code> eat </code>, <code> take </code>, <code> drop </code> , <code> launchRocket </code>
are these methods. You can do one of them when it is your turn to act.
For example :
<code>
public void doIt()
{
	move();
	move();
	launchRocket(120);
}
</code>
Finally the action of the robot will be a try for a rocket launch. (but the two <code> move </code>invocations will
not cost anything (energy) to the Robot, they are overwritten by the invocation of <code> launchRocket </code>.
<p>
Moreover, some methods are only available for a specific type of Body (a Robot).
In fact you can be a rocket launcher or an explorer (before starting a warbot game, you have to associate brain classes
with the robots of your team).
For example, each type of robot can move. But a rocket launcher can launch rocket and can not take things
(it does not have a bag to do this).
On contrary, an explorer can not launch rocket, but it owns a bag that can hold things (only hamburger for now).
So, all the methods that are related to a bag possesion can not be invoke by a rocket launcher.
So a Robot behavior, implemented as a subclass of
<class>Brain</Brain>, must be designed with this in mind.

Each type of robot also differs in their speed, initial energy, detecting range ...
