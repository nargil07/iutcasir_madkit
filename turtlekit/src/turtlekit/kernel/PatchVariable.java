/**Use this class to create a numeric patch variable (double). Having created one,
   you can set its evaporation and diffusion coefficients to a specific percentage
	(0 <= coef <= 1). You can also give a default value for this flavor (when the simualtion
	starts each patch has its own flavor with the given default value).
	Evaporation simply consists in deacrease the value.
	Diffusion makes each patch share a percentage of a value with
	its eight neighboring patches.
